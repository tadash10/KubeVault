#In this Dockerfile, we start with the official Python 3.9 slim-buster image as the base. We then set the working directory to /app and copy the script and requirements.txt file into the container.

#Next, we install the required dependencies using pip and expose port 8080 for the API server.

#Finally, we set the entrypoint to the script so that it is executed when the container starts. This Dockerfile assumes that the script is named kubernetes_secrets.py and that it is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
